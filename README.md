# OSINT:SRC

Osint:Src is a platform designed for users to share intelligence tip offs and security threats to a global audience. It leverages the power of Google's Firebase and Firestore to provide secure, real time updates to users when new incidents are added to the database.

The project's front end runs on Vue Js, providing a slick UX and by utilising a component based UI makes maintaining and developing the project simple.
